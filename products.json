This powerful story alternates with the tale of a white schoolteacher who, embittered by the horrific state of his country, is preparing to leave. Before he can do so he must confront his own demons and personal failings.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br>In this searing and timely novel, reminiscent of the work of J.M. Coetzee and Cormac McCarthy, the devastating effects of a country's economic and moral collapse provide the backdrop for a story about individual fortitude and conscience. <p/>In an unnamed and post-apocalyptic African republic, militiamen seize a scavenger as he is digging for roots, or anything that will nourish him and keep him alive. He is traded and ransomed and ends up in the hands of another group, whose members include a pregnant woman whom he is forced to carry in a wheelbarrow on a nightmarish and seemingly endless overland journey. This story alternates with the diary entries of a white schoolteacher who, embittered by the horrific state of his country, is preparing to leave. Before he can do so, however, he must confront his own demons and personal failings. Both narrators are in danger and both are apparently helpless to control their fates. When these two plotlines brilliantly and surprisingly unite the result is electrifying, shocking, and brilliant. <p/>With sparse and heartbreaking prose Ian Holding asks vital questions about personal responsibility, choice, and truth.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Praise for <i><b>Of Beasts and Beings</b></i> <p/>Merciless, poetic, and beautiful...

Abandoned farmhouses litter the isolated mountain valleys and shady hollows. The economy has been reduced to barter and trade. </p><p>In this craggy, unwelcoming world, the central character of <i>Scribe </i>ekes out a lonely living on the family farmstead where she was raised and where her sister met an untimely end. She lets a migrant group known as the Uninvited set up temporary camps on her land, and maintains an uneasy peace with her cagey neighbors and the local enforcer. She has learned how to make paper and ink, and she has become known for her letter-writing skills, which she exchanges for tobacco, firewood, and other scarce resources. An unusual request for a letter from a man with hidden motivations unleashes the ghosts of her troubled past and sets off a series of increasingly calamitous events that culminate in a harrowing journey to a crossroads.</p><p>Drawing on traditional folktales and the history and culture of Appalachia, Alyson Hagy has crafted a gripping, swiftly plotted novel that touches on pressing issues of our time--migration, pandemic disease, the rise of authoritarianism--and makes a compelling case for the power of stories to both show us the world and transform it.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><p>\"<i>Scribe</i>, which begins with the baying of hounds and ends with silence, reminds us on every page that humans remain the storytelling animal, and that therein might lie our salvation. . . . In this brave new world, a woman with a pen may prove mightier than a man with a sword.\"<b>--<i>The New York Times Book Review </i></b></p><p>\"It's a hungry book--one where every sentence seems to imply a second that it never offers; where every page and every paragraph offers the ghost of a feast, but never lets you eat.\"<b>--NPR.org </b></p><p>\"Fans of Fiona Mozley's <i>Elmet</i> will revel in this genre-busting feminist folktale of a novel, which is as rooted in its own particular, peculiar time as it is relevant to the concerns of 2018.\"<b>--<i>Vanity Fair </i></b></p><p>\"[An] eerie, artfully etched post-apocalyptic tale.\"<b>--<i>BBC Culture</i></b></p><p>\"Though setting, identity and motivations are shrouded in Blue Ridge mist, Hagy's language is intense and crisp. . . . Hagy does a splendid job of intertwining the strange threads in her novel, and readers with a taste for magical doings will not be disappointed.\"<b>--<i>Star Tribune</i></b> (Minneapolis) </p><p>\"Rooted in [Hagy's] Appalachia and yet otherworldly, bound by symbols and held just slightly out of time, <i>Scribe</i> is a storyteller's book about the radical power and responsibility of words.\"<b>--<i>The Millions </i></b></p><p>\"An original addition to the post-apocalyptic genre, Scribe reaffirms the power of the pen and the surviving quality of the human spirit.\"<b>--<i>The Arkansas International</i></b></p><p>\"A slim and affecting powerhouse. . . . Hagy is a careful writer; each sentence feels as solid and sturdy as stone. . . . Timely and timeless; a deft novel about the consequences and resilience of storytelling.\"<b>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review </b></p><p>\"Hagy probes the weight of responsibility and the desperation of survival in a deteriorated society in this evocative, opaque tale. . . . The vagueness of setting, supernatural elements, and only partially revealed histories amp up the eeriness of this disquieting novel.\"<b>--<i>Publishers Weekly </i></b></p><p>\"More than a novel. . . . [<i>Scribe</i>] defies the hush of a dying world with every breathtaking sentence.\"<b>--H\u00e9rnan D\u00edaz</b></p><p>\"Alyson Hagy has written a lyrical, unsettling novel--part ghost story, part mystery, part love story, and thoroughly, jarringly, original.\"<b>--Elizabeth Crook</b></p><br><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><b>Alyson Hagy</b> was raised on a farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. She is the author of seven previous works of fiction, most recently <i>Boleto</i>. She lives in Laramie, Wyoming.",

But no one could have foreseen that the greatest success story to arise from these events would be the worldwide rise of organized crime. Today, it is estimated that illegal trade accounts for one-fifth of the global GDP. <p/>In this fearless and wholly authoritative investigation of the seemingly insatiable demand for illegal wares, veteran reporter Misha Glenny travels across five continents to speak with participants from every level of the global underworld--police, victims, politicians, and even the criminals themselves. What follows is a groundbreaking, propulsive look at an unprecedented phenomenon from a savvy, street-wise guide.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><p>\"A smart, outraged, and vividly described whirlwind tour of criminal conspiracy....

Readers yearning for a deeper understanding of the real-life, international counterparts to <i>The Sopranos</i> need look no further than Glenny's engrossing study.\"<br> --<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <p/> \"In this well-researched and riveting account, Glenny does for crime what he did for the Balkans.

Nitrogen deficiency reduces the fertility of the soil and affects the crop production severely. Plants absorb nitrogen through their roots in the form of nitrate and ammonium ions. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and is responsible for the activation of various enzymes. Nitrogen based fertilizers are the most important means of nitrogen management. They play an important role in the areas with prolonged wet field conditions which makes the soil nitrogen deficient. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can cause nitrogen pollution. Alternative nitrogen sources such as organic residues and biological nitrogen fixation could be used to manage nitrogen effectively and increase the crop yield while reducing the harmful effects on the environment. The various studies that are constantly contributing towards advancing technologies and evolution of this field are examined in detail. Also included herein is a detailed explanation of the various concepts and applications of nitrogen management in crop production. For all those who are interested in crop production, this book can prove to be an essential guide.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br>Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient which is considered as a mineral element.

            "description": "12.5 cup capacity, 11.0\"d x 8.0\"high The Art of Polish Pottery, as we know it today, started as local folk art centuries ago in the German province of Silesia. The first known pieces of \u201cBunzlauer\u201d stoneware dating back to the 16th century were crafted by hand and decorated with a folk art stamping technique using potatoes. Original designs were inspired by the peacock feather using the colors of cobalt blue, sage green and ferrous red. These designs and colors are still the inspiration for modern day patterns.Today, skilled Polish artists still individually handcraft and hand decorate each piece using small sponges to stamp each pattern and color. After the process of mixing ingredients, molding the pottery, applying the decorations and glaze, the pottery is twice fired. This process makes the pottery extremely durable, it will not crack or chip easily, and it is perfect for use in the microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer. Along with our pottery, we have sourced a range of absolutely beautiful hand blown glassware from Poland. It is the perfect addition to your Polish Pottery Collection!",

            "description": "<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p>Ever since President John F. Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas 50 years ago, various theories have swirled around what was a key event in American--and world--history. Despite the conclusions of the Warren Report--that the President had been assassinated by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald--many people doubt that to be true. Indeed, President Nixon later admitted on tape that the report was \"a hoax committed on the American people.\" John Hughes-Wilson, a former colonel in British Intelligence, set out in 2007 to go through the millions of words and thousands of pieces of evidence, to put together an intelligence jigsaw of what really happened that dreadful high noon in Dallas in 1963. The result is a dramatic exposure of what actually took place and a clear indication that, while some of the pieces of that jigsaw may be missing, the truth is emerging. While the U.S. Federal Archive still keeps a million documents relating to the case under lock and key, it is beyond reasonable doubt that Jack Kennedy was the victim of a plot to remove the President of the United States. John Hughes-Wilson highlights the facts behind why Marilyn Monroe had to be silenced, LBJ's corrupt secrets, the Kennedys' secret Cuban coup plans, how the mafia manipulated politicians and the CIA, and how the assassination was covered up. Reading this book no one can be in any doubt that JFK's death was not at the hands of a lone deranged gunman, but a deadly plot to remove a President who threatened vested interests at home and abroad.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><b>Colonel John Hughes-Wilson</b> served in the British Army's Intelligence Corps for 30 years and is a specialist consultant to the UN and the European Union. He is the author of <i>A Brief History of the Cold War</i>, <i>Military Intelligence Blunders</i>, and <i>The Pupper Masters</i>.",

He was a singular American treasure.\"--Tim McGrawcGraw<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><b>\"Larry Brown wrote the way the best singers sing: with honesty, grit, and the kind of raw emotion that stabs you right in the heart. He was a singular American treasure.\" --Tim McGraw</b> <p/>A career-spanning collection, <i>Tiny Love</i> brings together for the first time the stories of Larry Brown's previous collections along with those never before gathered. The self-taught Brown has long had a cult following, and this collection comes with an intimate and heartfelt appreciation by novelist Jonathan Miles. We see Brown's early forays into genre fiction and the horror story, then develop his fictional gaze closer to home, on the people and landscapes of Lafayette County, Mississippi. And what's astonishing here is the odyssey these stories chart: Brown's self-education as a writer and the incredible artistic journey he navigated from \"Plant Growin' Problems\" to \"A Roadside Resurrection.\" This is the whole of Larry Brown, the arc laid bare, both an amazing story collection and the fullest portrait we'll see of one of the South's most singular artists.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>\"Blunt, brilliant tales of hardscrabble lives.\" <br> --<i><b>The New York Times Book Review</b></i> <p/> \"Drawn in gritty, deceptively simple prose, his characters drink too much, smoke too much, and flout the law when they can. But Brown proves that the coarsest material can produce the most affecting art.\" <br> --<i><b>Men's Journal</b></i> <p/> \"The complete collection of Brown's darkly comic short stories starring smart and salty workaday Southerners . . . Now counted among the titans of modern Southern storytellers, Brown lived a life that proclaimed the power of writing your own dream.\" <br> --<i><b>Garden & Gun</b></i> <p/> \"This collection showcases the depth of Brown's work and his evolution as a Mississippi artist and writer.\" <br> --<i><b>Deep South Magazine</b></i> <p/> \"There is a stark, stripped-down quality to Brown's writing. His language is blunt and sometimes coarse. It is the pitch-perfect voice for telling the indelible stories of these working-class men and women who strive to do right but who often prove to be their own worst enemies.\" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution\u200b</b></i> <p/> \"A thorough testament to his loving eye for rural minutiae. The details in each story . . . could only be the work of someone who'd shared an Old Milwaukee or two with his characters . . . <i><b>Tiny Love </b></i>showcases Brown's singular, unconditional empathy for the drunk and neglectful, the depraved but helpless, the ornery yet resigned--all the dogs that don't make it across the highway.\" <br> --<i><b>INDY Week</b></i> <p/> \"Threads of humor and grace run through the tales of violence, infidelities, and alcoholism, masterfully introducing an unexpected compassion. Brown excels at capturing psychological complexity with spare, humane prose in an original voice that was sadly lost to us far too soon.\" <br> --<i><b>Booklist</b></i> <p/> \"[An] outstanding, capacious volume . . . Whether exploring the underbelly of love or the despair of editorial rejection, Brown's stories drip with often uncomfortable detail as he describes the crass, the ugly, and the broken in ways unique and captivating.\" <br> --<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i> <p/> \"Larry Brown was a celebrated writer of the grit lit genre who wrote spare, brutal stories about hard-drinking, love-hungry barflies, Vietnam vets, hunters, bricklayers and loggers.\" <br> --<i><b>Atlanta Journal Constitution</b></i> <p/> \"A career-spanning collection by a master of American realism . . . Compassionate and gritty and lyrical--a master class.\" <br> --<i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i> <p/> \"When I discovered <i>Big Bad Love</i>, I went back and read everything. That man could write. He moved through life with a discerning eye and a capacity for language that I wanted. How did he do that? Story makes sense of what cannot make sense just by showing you the broken tragic heart that goes on beating. Which he did so beautifully. And with a sense of humor, Lord save us . . . I could read Larry Brown anytime, even though I know what's coming, even though I know he's going to break my heart again.\" <br> --<b>Dorothy Allison, author of <i>Bastard Out of Carolina</i></b> <p/> \"Larry Brown wrote stories that captured both the beauty and the brokenness of life. He never blinked at life's darkness, but drew you into it with his characters. Larry Brown wrote the way the best singers sing: with honesty, grit, and the kind of raw emotion that stabs you right in the heart. He was a singular American treasure.\" <br> --<b>Tim McGraw</b><br>",

The book chronicles Cynthia's story alongside the recipes she and her family eat every day--beginning when she met her husband at law school and ate out of two battered red bowls, through the first years of her legal career in New York, to when she moved to Los Angeles to start a family. <p/>As Cynthia's life has changed, her cooking has become more diverse. She shares recipes that celebrate both the commonalities and the diversity of cultures: her mother-in-law's spicy Korean-inspired take on Hawaiian poke, a sticky sesame peanut pie that combines Chinese peanut sesame brittle with the decadence of a Southern pecan pie, and a grilled cheese topped with a crisp fried egg and fiery kimchi. And of course, she shares the basics: how to make soft, pillowy steamed buns, savory pork dumplings, and a simple fried rice that can form the base of any meal. Asian food may have a reputation for having long ingredient lists and complicated instructions, but Cynthia makes it relatable, avoiding hard-to-find ingredients or equipment, and breaking down how to bring Asian flavors home into your own kitchen. <p/>Above all, Cynthia believes that food can bring us together around the same table, no matter where we are from. The message at the heart of <i>A Common Table</i> is that the food we make and eat is rarely the product of one culture or moment, but is richly interwoven--and though some dishes might seem new or different, they are often more alike than they appear.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br><i>LA-based food blog star Cynthia Chen McTernan stuns with this accessible, and personal, story of how she blends her Chinese heritage with her Southern upbringing. . . . The photography, which Chen McTernan shoots herself, is phenomenal[, ] and the recipes are pretty easy, good enough for a novice cook to start spending more time in the kitchen. [T]he story of melding cuisines and heritage is a classic Angeleno story of reinvention and discovery.</i> - MATTHEW KANG, <i>Eater LA</i><br><i><br>Lawyer/food blogger Cynthia Chen McTernan's primary food influences are Southern (from her childhood), Korean (from her mother-in-law) and Chinese (from her family). Sound promising? For good reason. . . . This is McTernan's first cookbook, and it has that feeling about it: hopeful, eclectic, conversational. I very much doubt it will be her last.</i> - T. SUSAN CHANG, NPR Book Concierge <p/>Cynthia has an incredible way of crafting a beautiful, engaging story around her recipes while making me want to eat every single one. Her recipes in <i>A Common Table </i>are approachable and crave-worthy, and her writing makes me feel like I'm conversing with a close friend. This is a cookbook that I will find myself reaching for over and over again!\" <br> --JESSICA MERCHANT, author of <i>Seriously Delish </i>and <i>The Pretty Dish</i>, and creator of <i>How Sweet Eats </i> <p/>\"Cynthia's world is a delicious mix of cultures that are all showcased beautifully in <i>A Common Table</i>. Her stories about these dishes paired with her stunning photos and the flavors themselves make this book<br> a true work of art.\" <br>--MOLLY YEH, author of <i>Molly on the Range </i> <p/>\"<i>A Common Table </i>is filled with evocative photographs, thoughtful writing, and gorgeous food in Cynthia's remarkable style. Her inventive recipes, inspired by her Southern upbringing, her Chinese heritage, and her husband's Korean-Irish roots, are comforting, craveable, and unique enough to stand out from the crowd. Cynthia's work is endlessly inspiring, and has translated beautifully to her first book!\" <br> --YOSSY AREFI, author of <i>Sweeter Off the Vine </i> <p/>\"Cynthia Chen McTernan's <i>A Common Table </i>effortlessly captures the spirit of American food right now--a rich and vibrant melting pot of influences from around the world. From her Chinese heritage to her Southern upbringing and her husband's Korean-Irish background, Cynthia's tales of embracing the 'shared cultures' of her family are as intoxicating as her mouthwatering, cross-cultural recipes. <i>A Common Table </i>is an important book for now and the future, a powerful story of how food, and the traditions of eating together, can help people from disparate cultures find common ground.\" <br> --HETTY McKINNON, author of <i>Community </i>and <i>Neighborhood, </i>editor in chief of <i>Peddler Journal, </i>and co-owner of Neighborhood Studio, Brooklyn <p/>\"Cynthia Chen McTernan's <i>A Common Table </i>feels new yet comfortingly familiar all at once. The sweet story of her food landscape and how it came to be will make you hungry in the best way possible.

            "description": "<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p><i>Two Arabic Travel Books</i> combines two exceptional exemplars of Arabic travel writing, penned in the same era but chronicling wildly divergent experiences. <i>Accounts of China and India</i> is a compilation of reports and anecdotes on the lands and peoples of the Indian Ocean, from the Somali headlands to China and Korea. The early centuries of the Abbasid era witnessed a substantial network of maritime trade--the real-life background to the Sindbad tales. In this account, we first travel east to discover a vivid human landscape, including descriptions of Chinese society and government, Hindu religious practices, and natural life from flying fish to Tibetan musk-deer and Sri Lankan gems. The juxtaposed accounts create a jigsaw picture of a world not unlike our own, a world on the road to globalization. In its ports, we find a priceless cargo of information; here are the first foreign descriptions of tea and porcelain, a panorama of unusual social practices, cannibal islands, and Indian holy men--a marvelous, mundane world, contained in the compass of a novella. <p/>In <i>Mission to the Volga</i>, we move north on a diplomatic mission from Baghdad to the upper reaches of the Volga River in what is now central Russia. This colorful documentary by Ibn Fadlan relates the trials and tribulations of an embassy of diplomats and missionaries sent by caliph al-Muqtadir to deliver political and religious instruction to the recently-converted King of the Bulghars. During eleven months of grueling travel, Ibn Fadlan records the marvels he witnesses on his journey, including an aurora borealis and the white nights of the North. Crucially, he offers a description of the Viking Rus, including their customs, clothing, tattoos, and a striking account of a ship funeral. <i>Mission to the Volga</i> is also the earliest surviving instance of sustained first-person travel narrative in Arabic--a pioneering text of peerless historical and literary value. <p/>Together, the stories in<i> Two Arabic Travel Books </i>illuminate a vibrant world of diversity during the heyday of the Abbasid empire, narrated with as much curiosity and zeal as they were perceived by their observant beholders. <p/>A bilingual Arabic-English edition.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Both these accounts are full of fascination and wonder. These volumes continue the contribution this excellent series is making towards integrating classics of Arabic into the global canon.-- \"Times Literary Supplement\"<br><br>Both travel accounts edited and translated here by Mackintosh-Smith and Montgomery are a tribute as well to the foresight, ambition, and excellent quality achieved by the Library of Arabic Literature. This will become a library of cultural richness and enduring value.-- \"Speculum\"<br><br>This welcome volume is one of the first in a new series that will be of inestimable value to both scholars and general readers.-- \"The Silk Road\"<br><br>We have been given a precious gift in <i>Two Arabic Travel Books. </i>Mackintosh-Smith and Montgomery bring their years of experience in the field, their towering erudition, and, most importantly, their love of the texts themselves--and of travel--to a wide audience that is most in need of a fresh look at the world shared by the peoples of Eurasia a millennium ago.-- \"Journal of the American Oriental Society\"<br><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><b>Ab\u016b Zayd al-S\u012br\u0101f\u012b (Author) </b><br> <b>Ab\u016b Zayd al-S\u012br\u0101f\u012b </b>was a seafarer who moved from the Persian port-city of Siraf to Basra in 303/915-916. He wrote the second half of <i>Accounts of China and India</i>, supplementing an earlier section written by an unknown mariner and merchant fifty years earlier. <p/><b>A\u1e25mad ibn Fa\u1e0dl\u0101n (Author) </b><br> <b>A\u1e25mad ibn Fa\u1e0dl\u0101n </b>was a member of a diplomatic mission sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir in 309-310/921-922 to the king of the Volga Bulghars.

She understands dance accompaniment better than anyone and explains how and why in her book.\"-- Mark Morris, artistic director, Mark Morris Dance Group</p><p>\"An insightful and detailed guide that will help novice dance musicians to navigate the demanding and often unstated expectations of the dance class, providing an invaluable resource for both dance teachers and dance musicians.\"-- Kathryn Daniels, Cornish College of the Arts, Seattle</p><p>\"All dance accompanists and teachers <i>must</i> own this publication.\"-- Ruth C. Petrinovic, consultant, Alabama Ballet School, Birmingham</p><p>Harriet Cavalli, internationally recognized as one of the most talented and experienced specialists in the art of music for dancers and dance teachers, presents here the definitive book on accompaniment, as well as her personal--often humorous--look behind the scenes at the world of dance. The text is enhanced by diagrams and 83 complete musical examples, providing a wealth of repertoire choices.</p><p>One of the most comprehensive books to acknowledge the intimate link between music and ballet technique, <i>Dance and Music</i> emphasizes the necessity of effective communication between dance teachers and their accompanists. Cavalli lays the groundwork with descriptions of most musical forms used in the dance classroom and stresses the need for teachers to make music a living part of their classes.</p><p>For the inexperienced accompanist, she describes the pianistic demands of the profession, as well as the qualities of dance steps and movements that will facilitate the identification of suitable music. She also discusses the kinds of dance classes an accompanist may work in and offers a lengthy section on the functions of a pianist in a dance company.</p><p>With forty years in the field, and firsthand knowledge of what dancing feels like and how to re-create that feeling, Cavalli invites musicians to move gracefully into the special, sometimes intimidating world of dance accompaniment.</p><p><b>Harriet Cavalli</b> is the company pianist for Martin Schl\u00e4pfer's BallettMainz at the Mainz State Theater in Germany. She has worked for most of the major dance institutions in New York, such as the Joffrey and Harkness Ballets and American Ballet Theater, and with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, First Chamber Dance Company in Seattle, Zurich Opera Ballet, Basel Ballet, and Bern Ballet. In addition, she has studied ballet with Perry Brunson, Maria Swoboda, Flemming Halby, Donna Silva, and Martin Schl\u00e4pfer.</p>",

He offers biblical lessons to aid in combatting bad habits and limiting patterns so that the best version of ourselves emerges. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> gives practical application to the story recorded in Genesis of Jacob wrestling with the man at the River Jabbok, and through it readers will learn how to become the persons they were created to be. The persons God intended each of us to be develops as we face our inner battles. With examples from his own life as well as his ministerial counseling, Gray provides a pathway to awakening. He includes strategies for confronting the past, how we have been labeled, who people have said we are, even who we think we are, so that we can win the battle and be who God intends us to be. Jacob spent much of his life running and hiding from himself. At a certain point we, like Jacob, cannot run from our true selves anymore. We must stop and face ourselves if we are to become great. <p/><i>Win FromWithin</i> helps us conquer our inner darkness and overcome such hindrances as fear, shame and guilt. This powerfully biblical self-help guide will push us toward victory over our inner struggles. Winning will make us the persons we have always wanted to be, the persons we have dreamed about becoming, the persons God created us to be.<p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>Most people monitor success by external responses; how many followers they have, how many likes they get, how many compliments they garner.

Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games. \n\n\nVariable Refresh Rate (VRR) for Smooth Gaming\n\nVRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.\n\n\n48Gbps Bandwidth\n\nAudioQuest \"48\" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.\n\n\n8K/10K\n\nAudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120.

In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by \"directing\" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.\n\n\neARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation\n\nBecause sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs.

Popular Christian blogger and teacher Adrian Warnock urges Christians not to neglect the implications of the resurrection.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><p>Jesus truly is alive today. But compared to his atoning death, Jesus's resurrection sparks relatively little discussion in the church. Inadvertently, we can become so focused on the good news that Christ died for our sins, that we almost forget he was raised for our justification (Romans 4:25).</p> <p>In <em>Raised with Christ</em>, author Adrian Warnock exhorts Christians not to neglect the resurrection in their teaching and experience. Warnock takes his cue from Acts, where every recorded sermon focuses on Jesus's resurrection. He stresses that Christians who faithfully proclaim both the death and the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and live out the implications of that message in vibrant, grace-filled churches, will be enabled to reach a world that lives in death's dark shadow.</p> <p>The power of the risen Christ is active in every true Christian, transforming our lives. <em>Raised with Christ</em> will help you discover afresh the massive implications of the empty tomb. Jesus's resurrection really has changed everything.</p><p/><br></br><p><b>  About the Author </b></p></br></br><p><strong>ADRIAN WARNOCK</strong> has been a regular preacher at Jubilee Church in London for more than ten years and serves on the church's leadership team.

Combined with the 60Hz refresh rate this enables smooth clear viewing of the high-speed action content often found in video games. \n\n\nVariable Refresh Rate (VRR) for Smooth Gaming\n\nVRR reduces or eliminates lag judder and frame tearing for more fluid and better detailed gameplay. Additionally VRR enables a gaming source (such as a console or computer) to deliver video frames as fast as it can.\n\n\n48Gbps Bandwidth\n\nAudioQuest \"48\" HDMI cables can transfer up to professional 10K Ultra-HD video. The 48Gbps bandwidth is made possible by 4 balanced audio/video pairs capable of 12Gbps each. The precision and tighter manufacturing tolerances required to produce HDMI cables that transfer up to 48Gbps bandwidth mean many of AudioQuests tried-and-true ingredients and techniques are more important than ever before.\n\n\n8K/10K\n\nAudioQuest 48Gbps HDMI cables have the bandwidth required for video with resolutions up to 10K and resolutions/refresh rates up to 8K/60 and 4K/120. All AudioQuest HDMI cables are completely backward compatible with existing 4K displays.\n\n\nLong-Grain Copper Conductors (HDMI)\n\nIn AudioQuest HDMI cables Solid Long-Grain Copper Silver-Plated Copper or Perfect-Surface Silver conductors improve Noise-Dissipation and overall performance. Pearl 48 uses Long-Grain Copper for its conductors.\n\n\nLevel 1 Noise-Dissipation (HDMI): Direction-Controlled\n\nThis is the foundation of AudioQuests Noise-Dissipation technologies. Traditional \"100% shielding\" is not enough to guard against the increasingly prevalent effects of Wi-Fi cellular and satellite radiation. In AudioQuest HDMI cables all 19 conductors are Direction-Controlled to minimize the RF Noise that damages performance by \"directing\" or draining it away from the most vulnerable circuits. Additional Noise-Dissipation techniques (Levels 2 and up) are applied as budget permits to further reduce noise.\n\n\neARC: LGC + Level-1 Noise-Dissipation\n\nBecause sound matters the eARC conductors in AudioQuest's 48-Series HDMI cables receive equal love and affection featuring the same superior metals Direction-Controlled Conductors and Noise-Dissipation technologies as the main AV data pairs. In AudioQuest eARC-Priority cables the main A/V data pairs have Cinnamon-level performance (Fores",

For a photographer whose work was grounded in the urgent value of documenting \"ordinary\" peoples' lives, these nuanced images--radiating a vast stillness of light and time, embedded with the granularity of lives lived--reveal Killip's conviction that no life is ordinary: everyday lives are sublime. <p/>First published in 2018 as a newspaper which he personally and anonymously put into every letterbox in the village, this new Steidl edition includes an introduction by the photographer and previously unpublished photos; it was completed shortly before Killip died in October 2020.</p>",

[1].<p/><br></br><p><b>  Book Synopsis </b></p></br></br><i>Seeing through Race</i> is a boldly original reinterpretation of the iconic photographs of the black civil rights struggle. Martin A. Berger's provocative and groundbreaking study shows how the very pictures credited with arousing white sympathy, and thereby paving the way for civil rights legislation, actually limited the scope of racial reform in the 1960s. Berger analyzes many of these famous images--dogs and fire hoses turned against peaceful black marchers in Birmingham, tear gas and clubs wielded against voting-rights marchers in Selma--and argues that because white sympathy was dependent on photographs of powerless blacks, these unforgettable pictures undermined efforts to enact--or even imagine--reforms that threatened to upend the racial balance of power.<p/><br></br><p><b>  From the Back Cover </b></p></br></br>\"<i>Seeing Through Race</i> is an indispensable and highly original account of how white Americans understood and remembered the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Berger shows us why photography was so central to civil rights, and his readings of iconic images are always penetrating and at times brilliant. His central argument, that whites wanted to be in charge of the movement, is complemented with rich insights on almost every page. It should be required reading for anyone interested in protest movements.\"<br /><br />--John Stauffer, Chair of the History of American Civilization and Professor of English and African and African American Studies at Harvard University <br /><br /><br /><br />\"The fervor of the 1960s civil rights movement may seem outdated by now, but terrible scenes enacted on the streets of Selma and Birmingham are preserved in the mass of surviving news photographs. Martin Berger argues that these pictures were never simple visual documents. By awakening the nation to the horrific violence of fire hoses and attack dogs, they defined what was meant by \"civil rights movement.\" Always engaging in its narrative as well as in its analytical and theoretical discourse, <i>Seeing through Race</i> is a stunning achievement both as history and as criticism.\" <br /><br />--Alan Trachtenberg, Neil Gray, Jr. Professor Emeritus of English and American Studies at Yale University<br /><br /><br /><br /><p/><br></br><p><b>  Review Quotes </b></p></br></br><br>\". . .

            "description": "12.5\" diameter x 4.5\" high - great for pasta dishes or large salads! The Art of Polish Pottery, as we know it today, started as local folk art centuries ago in the German province of Silesia. The first known pieces of \u201cBunzlauer\u201d stoneware dating back to the 16th century were crafted by hand and decorated with a folk art stamping technique using potatoes. Original designs were inspired by the peacock feather using the colors of cobalt blue, sage green and ferrous red. These designs and colors are still the inspiration for modern day patterns.Today, skilled Polish artists still individually handcraft and hand decorate each piece using small sponges to stamp each pattern and color. After the process of mixing ingredients, molding the pottery, applying the decorations and glaze, the pottery is twice fired. This process makes the pottery extremely durable, it will not crack or chip easily, and it is perfect for use in the microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer. Along with our pottery, we have sourced a range of absolutely beautiful hand blown glassware from Poland. It is the perfect addition to your Polish Pottery Collection!",
